### what is zulu5

botlab.io researchers have been using zulu5 inventory monitoring tool in various ad quality related research projects, and found it invaluable. 

There are two primary ways in which we've benefited from the tool: 
 
1) track specific brands to identify where their ads are shown 

2) track specific sites to identify what ads are shown on those sites

Simple, yet pretty amazing.
